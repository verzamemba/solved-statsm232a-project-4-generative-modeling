<h1>1           Variational Autoencoder</h1>

Read sections 2 and 3 in <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.6114.pdf</a> for implementation details. Specifically, you need to inplement the reparameterization trick, and use equation (10) as loss term.

Fill the blank parts in ./vae/model vae.py. After training, show the reconstructed images and sampled images. If tuning network structure carefully, you should get good results after 30 epoches.

<h1>2           Generative Adversarial Network</h1>

Read section 3 in <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf">https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-ne</a>ts. <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5423-generative-adversarial-nets.pdf">pdf</a> for implementation details. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.06434.pdf</a> contains more tricks about how to define your network structure.

Fill the blank parts in ./gan/model gan.py. After training, show the sampled images. You should also get good results after 30 epoches.
